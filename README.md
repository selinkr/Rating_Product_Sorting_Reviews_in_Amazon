# Rating_Product_Sorting_Reviews_in_Amazon
It is a project that aims to effectively calculate the post-sale ratings for products and to sort the reviews correctly for Online Retailer Amazon. The data set used in the project includes real data from Amazon.

One of the most important problems in e-commerce is the correct calculation of the points given to the products after the sale. 
The solution to this problem is to provide more customer satisfaction for the e-commerce site, the product to stand out for the sellers and a smooth
shopping experience for the buyers.

Another problem is the correct ordering of the reviews deemed appropriate to the products. Since misleading comments will directly affect the sale of the product,
it will cause both financial loss and loss of customers. 
With the solution of these problems, e-commerce site and sellers will increase their sales, while customers will complete their purchasing journey 
without any problems.
